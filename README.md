# McCann Fuels and Haulage 

mcannfuelsandhaulage.co.uk 


## Running this 

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
# Site now running at http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploying 

Deployed via [[Vercel](https://vercel.com/paultreanors-projects/mccannfuelsandhaulage)].

## Build thoughts
- `npm init gatsby` w/ TailwindCSS still the easiest way to build a website
- `bun` speeds everything up for small projects like this when it works 
- Vercel remains to be literally 10 times easier to deploy a site with DNS. Like start to finish 20 minutes and almost all of that is waiting time for DNS stuff. I would pay â‚¬10/month per website for this service.
