# McCann Fuels and Haulage 

[mccannfuelsandhaulage.co.uk](https://mccannfuelsandhaulage.co.uk)

## Running this 

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
# Site now running at http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploying 

Deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/paultreanors-projects/mccannfuelsandhaulage).

## Build thoughts
- `npm init gatsby` w/ TailwindCSS still the easiest way to build a website
- `bun` is now default choice for small projects with few dependencies.
- Vercel still 10 times better than any other way to host a site. Literally 5 minutes to deploy a site, plus a 15 minute wait for DNS to update. Easily worth â‚¬10/month per site.
